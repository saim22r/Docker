# Docker
### What is Docker?
Docker is a containerisation platform, open source platform, that enables developers to seperate their applications from their infrastructure. It does this by utilising containers.
Containers images are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
It  is a tool created by Google and later made open source and transferred to the Linux foundation. It helps create, modify, delete and otherwise manage containers

### Containers and VMs
A container is similar to a Virtual Machine in that both are closed boxes (separated from the host machine) on which to run software. The main difference between a VM and a container is that while a virtual machine simulates the whole operating system on which to run software, a container is only provided with the minimal necessary dependencies to run a specific application, and is therefore much more lightweight and faster, but while trading-off flexibility and scope.

### Benefits of using containers
- Docker is more lightweight
- Start-up time is much faster
- Easily adaptable
- Run multiple containers as they share the same OS
- Integrate with other tools
- They don't require the whole OS
